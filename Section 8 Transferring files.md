Section 8 applies only to in-person workshop participants.

When working on a remote machine like an HPC system, transferring data (in both directions!) is a common task. FileZilla provides a useful interface for these transfers.

## Transfer files with Filezilla

Open FileZilla on your local computer. At the top of the window, enter the following information in the boxes as shown in the image below.

| **Field**      | **Enter the below information**              |
|:-------------- |:---------------------------------------------|
| `Host:`        | IP address from provided spreadsheet         |
| `Username:`    | Username from provided spreadsheet           |
| `Password`     | Password from provided spreadsheet           |
| `Port`         | 22                                           |
